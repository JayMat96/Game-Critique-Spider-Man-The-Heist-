### Review

Marvel's Spider-Man for the PlayStation 4 is an open-world action adventure game based on the famous comicbook superhero of the same name. It was developed by Insomniac Games and was released earlier this year. The base game would have the player take control of Spider-Man as he swings around New York, stopping crimes, solving mysteries, and chasing down bad guys. A few collectables are scattered throughtout the city for the player to find, encouraging exploration. There are a few missions that had the player take control of either Mary Jane Watson or Miles Morales. However, I focused on the first of three post-game DLC expansions for Spider-Man. The first expansion is called "The Heist." It has the player track down Felicia Hardy, aka The Black Cat, as she steals from various mob families. 

The expansion adds new suits for the player to wear, new sidemissions, new enemies, and of course, new story missions. The base game had enemies representing different factions, such as Kingpin's men of The Demons, The Heist adds the Magia as a new criminal faction in the game. The Magia faction brings with it a new enemy type. This enemy is a brute that shoots a gatling gun which is a much tougher enemy than a standard brute, requiring throwing more objects at the gatling gun brute to stun him than was required of the standard brute.

### What Needs to be Tested

Name 3-5 aspects of the game you think should be tested and why?

Example: 

The tennis game on Wii Sports is a very fun and easy game to play. The maker of Wii sports is Nintendo and there are several other sports that can be played on the Wii Sports game disc. After playing the tennis game on Wii Sports, there are several functions I think a tester would look at.

One function that would be looked at immediately is the player mode/selection. A total of four players can play a tennis match; this can be done with 1 Wii remote or multiple Wii remotes. Another important function that might be tested is the player movement, making sure the direction you are moving is in line with the game.  Scoring would be another major function that should be tested, if a player hits the ball out of bound or hits the net, making sure a proper out occurs and the scoring is incremented correctly.
