Marvel's Spider-Man for the PlayStation 4 is an open-world action adventure game. It was developed by Insomniac Games and was released earlier this year. The base game would have the player take control as Spider-Man as he swings around New York, stopping crimes, solving mysteries, and chasing down bad guys. A few collectables are scattered throughtout the city for the player to find, encouraging exploration. There are a few missions that had the player take control of either Mary Jane Watson or Miles Morales. However, I focused on the first of three DLC expansions for Spider-Man. The first expansion is called "The Heist." It has the player track down Felicia Hardy, aka The Black Cat, as she steals from various mob families. The expansion also adds new suits, new sidemissions, and new enemies. One new enemy is a brute that shoots a gatling gun. 

Example: 

The tennis game on Wii Sports is a very fun and easy game to play. The maker of Wii sports is Nintendo and there are several other sports that can be played on the Wii Sports game disc. After playing the tennis game on Wii Sports, there are several functions I think a tester would look at.

One function that would be looked at immediately is the player mode/selection. A total of four players can play a tennis match; this can be done with 1 Wii remote or multiple Wii remotes. Another important function that might be tested is the player movement, making sure the direction you are moving is in line with the game.  Scoring would be another major function that should be tested, if a player hits the ball out of bound or hits the net, making sure a proper out occurs and the scoring is incremented correctly.

These are just a few of the initial functions that would a tester would need to look at when evaluating the Wii Sports tennis game.
